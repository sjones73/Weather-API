### Project 6 Weather Dashboard API

### Project Overview
The Weather Dashboard application utilizes server-side APIs to fetch and display weather data for multiple cities. It is designed for travelers who need to plan trips based on current and future weather conditions.

### User Story
As a traveler, I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities so that I can plan a trip accordingly.

The application allows users to input a city name and receive current and 5-day weather forecasts. Users can also view previously searched cities in their search history and revisit the weather details of those cities by clicking on them.

### Features
City Weather Search: Users can input a city name and retrieve the current and future weather data for that location.
Current Weather: Displays the city name, date, weather icon, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
5-Day Forecast: Shows weather conditions for the next 5 days, including the date, an icon representation of the weather, temperature, wind speed, and humidity.
Search History: Users can view and select from previously searched cities to display their current and future weather conditions again.

### Technologies Used
HTML/CSS: For the layout and styling of the application.
JavaScript: To dynamically update the HTML and interact with the API.
Bootstrap: For responsive design and UI components.
OpenWeather API: Used to retrieve current and forecasted weather data.
jQuery: For handling user interactions and DOM manipulation.

### Project Instructions
Search for a city:

Enter a city name in the search bar.
Once location is submitted, the current weather and a 5-day forecast for that city will be displayed.
The city will be added to the search history.

View current weather conditions:
You will see the city name, date, weather icon, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
View future weather conditions:

A 5-day forecast will display the date, weather icon, temperature, wind speed, and humidity for each day.
Search history:

Click on a previously searched city from the history list to view its weather data again.

### Future Enhancements
Add location support to automatically show weather for the userâ€™s current location.
Implement unit conversion for temperature (Celsius/Fahrenheit).

Enhance UI with more detailed weather information (e.g., UV index, sunrise/sunset times).
